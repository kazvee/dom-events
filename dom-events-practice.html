<!-- NOTES

When your cursor is in the textarea and you press the SHIFT key, what events get triggered? Is keypress one of them? Why or why not?
A keydown gets triggered, but NOT a keypress or an input. Nothing was inputted. 
It is not a keypress because keypress shows WHICH character was entered, and in the case of SHIFT key, there is no character entered.
  
What's the difference between keydown and keypress?
Keydown indicates which KEY is pressed.
Keypress indicates which CHARACTER was entered.

If you hold down the SHIFT key and then press the A key, what event fires? Did everything happen in the order that you expected?
Only a keydown gets triggered and the A key doesn't get entered. 

How do the keyboard event objects differ from each other? (For example, how is the event object different when pressing the A key by itself vs. pressing it with the SHIFT key pressed down?
Pressing the letter A key by itself is a keydown, a keypress, and an input.
Pressing the letter A key with the SHIFT key pressed down only registers the keydown for the SHIFT key, and doesn't have an event for anything to do with the letter A key.

With some text already in the box, press the DELETE/BACKSPACE key to delete a character. Do you expect the events to be the same or different from the examples above?
Delete/Backspace registers a keydown and an input

What happens if you add 2 identical event listeners? Does JavaScript complain about this or does it run the callback functions in both event listeners? 
It doesn't complain, it runs both event listeners.
